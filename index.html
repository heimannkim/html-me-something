        <h1>Current Top 5 Kentucky Oaks Contenders Based on Points and Earnings</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The Kentucky Derby is one of the most famous American horse races. It is run on the first Saturday in May.
            This race is for three-year old colts. Fillies can run in this race too, but that does not happen very
            often. A lesser known race, the Kentucky Oaks, is the three-year old filly equivalent of the Derby. The Oaks
            is run on the Friday before Derby Saturday. My website will concentrate on the current top five fillies for
            the Oaks race.</p>
        <p>Only the top 14 horses are allowed to run in the Kentucky Oaks. There are 6 more Oaks prep races left in
            which points from 1 to 100 are awarded to the top 4 finishers based on the grade of the race. Will these
            fillies be a part of that top 14? Weâ€™ll have to wait and see!</p>
